# HackathonWebsite-MarlonMichaelSebastian

This is a program created for our computer science class, featuring a website surrounding goal 11 of the UN sustainable development goals. Included in the website is a variety of programs and applications with the purpose of engaging the user with issues surrounding sustainable cities. 

Run down of the program:

Website coded with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a Front End that provides the user with statistics and helpful imformation regarding the programs we face regarding sustainable cities. The website also includes navigation features, inclduing the option to play our city simulator game, and to give ideas for what we should do to activily partake in creating susainable cities. 

City simulator game coded with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to provie an interavtive and engaging way to learn about creating sustainable cities. Users will select one of three starting locations where they must manage reasoureses to provie the city with new buildings, which will increase or decerease different aspects of what makes a city sustainable. Users can end the simulation when they are happy with thier progress, and a final sustinability score will be given.

Feedback/Idea page coded with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to allow users to share thier voice on creating sustabable cities. A backend, created with Firebase, stores all user ideas in a real-time database which can be used to activeishre share and spread ideas surreoudnging sustainable cities.

Development process:
When we started our program, we had a solid plan on how we were going to communicate the ideas we wanted to share surrounding sustianable cities. This included a varity f ways for the user to interave and engage with the website, with the program entering around our ciy simulator game. Although our game did not have a clear structure as we were constantly changing/adding the mechanics of the game, we still managed to develop a game that is able to express the ideas of managing reasureses to be able to make our cities more sustainable. 

Next Steps
- Make the simulation more complex and engaging (i.e. updated assets and graphics as well as better gameplay mechanics and rules), and finish implementing features
- Further developing more backend functionality such as linking databases to the game rather than just a comment board
- Include additional JavaScript programs to enhance engagement with sustainability issues
- Implementing modern graphic design to our website with HTML
